        Instructions: You have been given a bunch of vegetables which need to be cooked into a delicious soup.
        We also want it to contain some herbs like coriander and cumin seeds as well.
        Finally we would like to add a spice called ""garam masala"" to make our soup really flavorful.
        Here is what I suggest you do,
        
        First of course you'll start off by chopping up all the veggies according to size so they can easily fit inside a blender or food processor.
        
        After that place them together along with rest of the listed ingredients except Garam Masala Powder & Salt in a pot and bring everything to boil till they become soft enough such that when you mash them between fingers there won't be any resistance left behind.
    
        Once done transfer half portion from boiling mixture back into same pot while keeping remaining one aside separately because now we're going to puree first batch itself before combining both batches again later.
    
        Place blended version directly onto high heat without allowing water content evaporate completely otherwise it might curdle out leading towards separation during next stage where all three components get mixed together once more time after being heated sufficiently throughly yet maintaining its original texture intact throughout process thereby resulting into desired outcome i.e creamy soupy consistency without compromising nutritional value nor losing taste due to excessive heating involved at each point during preparation stages mentioned earlier.""""""

         Preparing Chicken Tikka Masala Sauce:

     Ingredients Used: 

      * Black Cardamom Pods (Bada Elachi), broken into pieces
       * Salt, to taste
       * Mustard Oil, for shallow frying
       * Ghee, for tempering
       * Asafoetida Powder (Hing)
       * Bay Leaves (Tejpattas), few
       * Curds/Yogurt, whisked well till smooth consistency
       * Fennel Seeds Powder (Saunf Poudre)
       * Cinnamon Sticks (Dalcheeni) – break them up at least 5-6 sticks in length
       * Whole Cloves (Laung), about half dozen
       * Mint Dry Leaves (Pudine Chhaat Peethi)
       * Chicken Breasts/Tenderloin Cut Into Cubes, Marinated In Yogurt With Ginger Garlic Paste & Spices For At Least An Hour Or Overnight In Refrigerator

   Directions To Make:

To begin making the recipe first marinate the cubed chicken breast slices in yogurt along with ginger garlic paste, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder and some salt and keep aside for atleast one hour before hand.
Heat little bit oil on low flame add chopped onion and saute till it turn soft and translucent.Now take out onions from the pan and let cool down.Once cooled grind it coarsely in mixer grinder without adding any water.Add the ground mixture back to the same pan now and stir continuously while stirring so that it does not burn at bottom and make sure you do not leave the pan unattended once you start stirring otherwise it can lead to formation of lumps.After five minutes, add tomato puree followed by grated ginger and green chili and simmer till it thickens.In between adjust seasoning accordingly if required.
Add curd/yoghurt, cream cheese, sugar, garam masala powder, kasuri methi and mix everything together.
Simmer for another 10 mins and check again for sweetness and spice level.Take care not to boil the sauce after adding yoghurt as it might split due to acidic nature of yoghurt.So just bring the gravy to rolling boil and then reduce the heat to very slow flame and cover with lid.Cook for further ten minutes and switch off.
Now in a heavy bottom kadai heat ½ cup oil and deep fry the chicken cubes until they become crisp and golden brown.Transfer fried tikka onto paper towels to drain excess oil.Remove fried chicken from the hot oil and place them directly into the prepared sauce.
Stir gently to coat evenly.Serve warm with naan breads / tawa paratha or steamed rice with raita.[/INST]
